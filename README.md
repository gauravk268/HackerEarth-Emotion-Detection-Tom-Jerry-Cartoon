# Machine Learning Projects

## What this Repository is About
This Repository contains all of the Machine Learning as well as Deep Learning Projects, that i have made for any Competition or have done only for Practice.
In this repo. all the projects will have at least one Complete Notebook, and the number of inComplete notebooks, i don't know. In some of the Projects the Dataset is not uploaded, along with the notebook, it is because the Dataset is very huge in size, but I have mentioned the Source or link of the dataset, if by mistake i have not mentioned it in any of the projects, let me know!. Hope you get benefitted with this repo of mine.
